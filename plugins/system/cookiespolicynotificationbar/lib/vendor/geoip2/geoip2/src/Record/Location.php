 * from the Insights service.
 * @property-read int|null $accuracyRadius The approximate accuracy radius in
 * kilometers around the latitude and longitude for the IP address. This is
 * the radius where we have a 67% confidence that the device using the IP
 * address resides within the circle centered at the latitude and longitude
 * with the provided radius.
 * @property-read float|null $latitude The approximate latitude of the location
 * associated with the IP address. This value is not precise and should not be
